        <p>Ambidexterity is the state of being equally adapted in the use of both the left and the right hand.[1][2] When referring to objects, the concept indicates that the object is equally suitable for right-handed and left-handed people. When referring to humans, it indicates that a person has no marked preference for the use of the right or left hand.</p>
